Homestuck Dating Sim is a game i've made on Ren'Py on a while, my idea was to make a generic dating sim game based on the Homestuck franchise, because I liked Homestuck
back, but the twist is the dating sim went downhill extremely fast and it was a completely different game (just noticed that's extremely similar to DDLC), but for now 
it's just a completely normal game where some extremely insignificant stuff happens. 
I'll tweak the story a little bit more because I stopped working on this project almost one year ago, randomly got motivated and did the entire third act of
the game (which to be honest is a huge upgrade in quality to the first two acts)
